# üöó Car Damage Detection for Insurance Claims

## üîç Overview
Car Damage Detection for Insurance Claims is a computer vision-based system designed to assist insurance companies by automating the process of vehicle damage detection and classification from images. This helps reduce human effort and speeds up the claims process.

The system performs:

- Damage Detection using Detectron2 (Mask R-CNN).
- Damage Classification using a custom CNN model.
- Built and tested in Google Colab using Python.
